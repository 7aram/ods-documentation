"The domain access list is made of users and groups of users to which "
"permissions are attached. Two different set of permissions can be defined: "
"permissions related to regular users and permissions related to admin users "
"(those guys with super powers). The permissions make it possible to allow "
"users to read the dataset catalog, create and publish new datasets or even "
"visualize and modify any dataset of the domain."

"Then, at the dataset level, it is possible to even further refine the "
"security model by giving specific access to users or groups to either view "
"or modify the dataset. It is also possible to define advanced filters so "
"that a given user will only see some fields and/or a subset of the dataset "
"records."
