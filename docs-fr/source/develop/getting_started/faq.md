# APIs FAQ

### What are APIs made for ?
APIs are a set of tools that developer can use to integrate data in their applications (Web applications, mobile applications, business applications...).

### How many API calls can I perform ?
API endpoints are associated with quotas. OpenDataSoft customers can configure their own quotas policy. Contact your OpenDataSoft domain owner for more details.

### Does each dataset have its own APIs ?
Yes and no.

No, because all our [APIs](/article/1389-available-apis) can be used with any dataset. 

Yes, because giving the dataset, the filtering and facetting features will vary as the dataset defines the available fields for **querying**, **sorting** and **facetting**.
